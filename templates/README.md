This folder contains template files for various art projects on wplace.live.

## ðŸ“‹ Important Information for All Templates

**Before using any template:**
- Download the template file to your computer
- Import it using Blue Marble overlay on wplace.live
- Check the coordinates to position correctly on the canvas

## Template Types

We provide two types of templates for each artwork to make collaborative pixel art easier and more organized:

### ðŸŒˆ **Full-Color Templates** 
Complete artworks showing all colors at once - perfect for:
- Getting the overall vision of the project
- Understanding the complete composition
- Seeing the final goal we're working towards

### ðŸŽ¯ **Single-Color Templates**
Individual templates for each specific color + high contrast outline for easy recognition. These make it much faster and easier to:
- **Focus on one color at a time** without confusion
- **Quickly identify** where specific colors go
- **Work efficiently** without switching between colors
- **Avoid mistakes** by having clear visual contrast

## Contrast Colors Used:
- **Light colors** (white, yellow,...): Use **black** contrast for visibility
- **Dark colors** (black, brown, ...): Use **white** contrast for visibility



### ðŸ’¡ **Tips:**
- **Start with outlines:** Black pixels usually define the shape
- **Work systematically:** Complete one color fully before moving to next
- **Check progress:** Use Blue Marble stats to see completion percentage
- **Coordinate:** Let others know which color you're working on




**Remember:** The single-color templates with contrast are designed to make your pixel placing much faster and more accurate. Use them to focus on one color at a time!

## ðŸŽ‰ Have fun!
